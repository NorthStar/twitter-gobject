twitter-gobject allows you access Twitter's 1.1 REST API via
a set of GObject based objects for easy integration with your
GLib2 based code.

What it covers so far:

- Status (update, update_with_media, show, destroy, retweet, retweets)
- Timeline (mentions_timeline, home_timeline)
- Oauth (request_token, access_token)
- examples/tests

It is very easy to extend, feel free to do it. I will gladly accept contributions.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/rgs1/facebook-gobject ;)
