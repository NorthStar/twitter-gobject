twitter-gobject allows you access Twitter's 1.1 REST API via
a set of GObject based objects for easy integration with your
GLib2 based code.

What it covers so far:

- Status (update, update_with_media, show, destroy, retweet, retweets)
- Timeline (mentions_timeline, home_timeline)
- Search (tweets)
- Oauth (request_token, access_token)
- examples/tests

What are the dependencies:

- python 2.7
- pycurl

Where is the documentation:

- https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1

How can you help:

- It is very easy to extend, feel free to do it. I will gladly accept contributions.
